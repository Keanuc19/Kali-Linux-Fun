//////////////////////// File Permissions //////////////////////

the permissions are broken down into 
  owner   group   others
  rwx     rwx     rwx
    
 4 r = read Permission
  -> allows you to open and view files 
  -> allows you to ls (list) the directories contents
  -> allows you to copy and move a file if you have write and execute permissions
  
 2 w = write Permission
  -> allows you to edit the contents of the file 
  -> allows you to copy and move files in the directory, this can only be done when paired with the execute permission
  
 1 x = Execute Permission
   -> allows you to run the file 
   -> must be paired with the write permission to allow the changing of directories
   
 // how to view current Permissions //
 
 using the command ls -l will show you a list of the files and on the left hand side it will show the permissions
 
 
 // what's a sticky bit //
 
 this is a special permission that can be assigned to a file or directory 
 this file can only be deleted by the owner or root if the sticky bit is enabled 
 we can see a that a sticky bit is active when a T is at the end of the file permission
 
 // how do i change a file or directories permissions //
 
 we can use the chmod command 
      // Option 1: With Letters //
      when using letters your command needs to contain the target, the operations and the permission
      
          // target list //
           -> u : Owner
           -> g : Group
           -> o : Other 
           -> a : All
          // Operations //
           -> + : add the permission
           -> - : removes the permission
          // example //
          -> chmod [target][operator][permission][filename]
          // setting the sticky bit //
          -> it can be added using +t
          -> removed using -t
        
      // Option 2: With Numbers //
      
         // permission numbers //
         -> 4 = Read 
         -> 2 = Write 
         -> 1 = Execute
         // Number Structure//
         the numbers need to be placed in the order of owner, group and others.
         the permission numbers can be added like 7 means read,write and execute so i permission of 777
         gives all users and groups the read,write and execute permission.
         // example //
         chmod [owner][group][others][filename]
         chmod 744 [filename]
         // setting the sticky bit //
          -> it can be added by adding a 1 infront of the user permissions
          -> removed by adding a 0 before the permission 
          
   
// How to change the owner of the file or directory //

using the command chown [new Owner][filename]

// How to change the group owner of a file //

using the command chgrp [new group][filename]
